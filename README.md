# Antenna Radiation Patterns & Beamforming Visualization

This project visualizes antenna radiation patterns and beamforming using Python and Matplotlib.

## Visualizations

1. *Polar Plot of Radiation Pattern*: Displays the radiation pattern of an antenna.
2. *3D Beamforming Plot*: Shows the gain distribution in a 3D space.
3. *Gain Distribution Heatmap*: Represents the gain distribution as a heatmap.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the visualizations.py script.
